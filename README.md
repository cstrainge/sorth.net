
# Sorth.net

An experimental implementation of the Strange Forth language in C#.  Unlike the C++ version, this
version generates MSIL from the Sorth byte code, which in turn gets translated to machine language.

So, this version is fully JITed.

This version isn't up to full feature parity with the original but the full standard library and
simple repl do work in this version.
